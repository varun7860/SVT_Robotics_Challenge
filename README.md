# SVT_Robotics_Challenge

Problem Statement: Make a function that takes 3 input arguments loadId,X,Y of the load and returns the best robot that can pick up that load in the following format:
```
{
    robotId: 58,
    distanceToGoal: 49.9, //Indicates how far the robot is from the load which needs to be moved.
    batteryLevel: 30 //Indicates current battery level of the robot.
}
```
## Installations
I have used python language for coding the functions.I have also used additional libraries that can perform HTTP Request, Performing mathematical functions and performing array operations. Below are the instructions to install those libraries:

1.Numpy Library - To Perform Array Operations
- ```pip3 install numpy```

2.Requests Library - To perform HTTP Request
- ```pip3 install requests```

3.Math Library - To perform Math Operations
- ```pip3 install python-math```

4.Random Library - To Randomly Generate Load id and Its position
- ```pip3 install random2```

I have made a requirements.txt file which you can use to install all these commands with one go like this
- ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

## My Solution

## Instructions for Running the Program
The repository contains a folder called code which has the main function program. Other files in the repository are README.md which contains the instructions to run the program and testing it. Following is the structure of the repository:

SVT_Robotics Challege
- Code
- README.md

To run the program go to the folder where the python program is saved and then run the python file. Given below are the steps to execute the program:

1. ```cd ~/SVT_Robotics_Challenge/Code```
2. ```Python3 main.py```
